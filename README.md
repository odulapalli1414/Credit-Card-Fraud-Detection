Credit Card Fraud Detection
Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced, with only a small fraction of transactions being fraudulent.

Project Structure
data: Contains the dataset (creditcard.csv) used for training and evaluation.
notebooks: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
README.md: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.
requirements.txt: List of required Python libraries and their versions.
scripts: Utility scripts for data preprocessing and model evaluation.
models: Trained machine learning models for fraud detection.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository: git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the project directory: cd credit-card-fraud-detection
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the Jupyter notebooks in the notebooks directory to explore the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate their performance.
Usage
Data Preprocessing: Use the provided notebooks to preprocess the dataset, including scaling, handling missing values, and balancing class distribution.
Model Training: Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data to detect fraudulent transactions. Different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Trees are implemented and evaluated.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure robust evaluation.
Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is trained and evaluated, deploy it in a production environment for real-time fraud detection.
