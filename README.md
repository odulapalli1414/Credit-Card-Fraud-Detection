# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. The dataset used contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders. It is highly imbalanced, with only a small fraction of transactions being fraudulent.

## Project Structure
- **notebooks**: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **README.md**: Overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is available on Kaggle at [Credit Card Fraud Detection]([https://www.kaggle.com/code/lakshmi25npathi/sentiment-analysis-of-imdb-movie-reviews/input](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)).


## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided above. 
3. Navigate to the project directory: `cd credit-card-fraud-detection`
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks` directory to explore the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate their performance.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Use the provided notebooks to preprocess the dataset, including scaling, handling missing values, and balancing class distribution.
2. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data to detect fraudulent transactions. Different algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Trees are implemented and evaluated.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation techniques are used to ensure robust evaluation.
4. **Deployment**: Once a satisfactory model is trained and evaluated, deploy it in a production environment for real-time fraud detection.
